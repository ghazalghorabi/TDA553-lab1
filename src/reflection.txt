We used subclassing and created a supertype that the subclasses inherited from. 
We went through the common attributes of the cars and put it into a super class that we called in the code.

Furthermore, we analyzed what specific characteristics the cars had that were not shared and those we did not include in the super class. 
For example in Saab we had one specific characteristic: Turbo which Volvo did not have and therefore we chose to have Turbo in the Saab file.
We took one method at a time and examined every case that could happen for each function. 
For example in compareSpeedAfterBrake and compareSpeedAfterGas where we compared the speed before and after braking/acceleration.
